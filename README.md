<h1 align="center">ðŸŒ© Dies ðŸŒ©</h1>

In Roman mythology [Dies](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_(mythology)>) (_dai-ez_) was the personification of day and the mother of Mercury.

Dies is the framework powering the [Delft Mercurian](https://delftmercurians.nl/)'s RoboCup AI. It consists of a core written in Rust, which includes a physics simulator, networking, vision data processing, game state management, and a Python API and executor. Strategies -- the high-level logic that governs the player's behaviors -- are written in Python and can be run in a separate process, allowing for hot reloading and easy debugging.

## Getting Started

You'll need the following dependencies on your system:

- Stable [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain. Use rustup if you can.

_TODO: Add instructions for running the framework_

## Documentation

Documentation is currently on Notion only.
